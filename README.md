# Noor

![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/ashes999/noor.svg)

Noor brings the best parts of working in C# to Haxe. The roadmap includes:

- LINQ-like lambdas for collections
- Common string methods: `StartsWith`, `EndsWith`, and more
- Container methods that return `true/false` instead of `indexOf(x) > -1`
- And more!

Noor is currently under heavy development. To consume it as a libray, use `haxlib git noor http://github.com/ashes999/noor`.
